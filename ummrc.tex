\newcommand\NTen{\ensuremath{\mathcal{N}_{10, 2}}}

Let \NTen{} be the set of positive integers whose digits in base-$10$ comprise only 0s and 1s. Examples of elements in \NTen{} are: $1001$, $110$, and $11$. Examples of elements not in \NTen{} are: $4201$, $690$, and $12$.

Consider a positive integer $N$. It can be constructed as the sum of elements in \NTen{}. For example, one construction of $1337$ with $8$ summands which are elements in \NTen{} is as follows
\[
  1337 = 1000 + 111 + 111 + 111 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
.\] 

\section{Problem 1}
\begin{problem}
  What are all of the constructions of $1337$ using elements of \NTen{}?
\end{problem}
We interpret the question as asking for how many unique ways there are to obtain $1337$ as a sum of elements from \NTen{}. To do this, we look at the general case which seeks to find the number of unique ways to obtain a positive integer  $n$ as a sum of elements from \NTen{}.
\begin{definition}
  For sake of convenience, we define a function $C(n)$ that counts the number of unique ways of constructing $n$ as a sum of elements in \NTen{}. That is, $C(n)$ is the number of unique constructions such that \[
    n = \sum_{a_i \in \NTen} a_i
  .\] 
\end{definition}
We start with an elementary example. Consider $n = 15$, and suppose we wish to find $C(15)$. Clearly, the only elements of \NTen{} that are relevant here are $1$, $10$ and $11$. With so few elements, we can easily calculate $C(15)$ manually. We find that there are three unique constructions of $15$, which are 
\begin{align*}
  15 &= 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 \\
  15 &= 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 \\
  15 &= 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 11.
\end{align*}
Hence $C(15) = 3$. However, this method quickly breaks down for large $n$, where the number of relevant elements of \NTen{} increases with the length of the number. For example, there are $15$ relevant elements of $\NTen$ for $n = 1337$, which are $1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000, 1001, 1010, 1011, 1100, 1101, 1110, 1111$. As such, we need a better way to count $C(n)$.
